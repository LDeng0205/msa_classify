PABP_YEAST
    model trained on all ~150k MSA aligned sequences
PABP_YEAST_X (where X is a number)
    model trained on the first X sequences (e.g. PABP_YEAST_10000 is a potts model trained on the first 10,000 sequences)
PABP_YEAST_X_Y (where X, Y are numbers)
    model trained on the Xth to Yth sequence (e.g. PABP_YEAST_10000_20000 is a potts model trained on the 10,000th to the 
    20,000th sequence; the training size is 10,000 sequences). These models are typically used for weights computation as 
    they do not contain the target sequence (wildtype), which is the first sequence in the dataset.
